## How to use

Let's get started!

To begin, either click the blue heart at the top of the screen (if you've been here before and created an account) or fill out the information on the right side. You can specify your gender, what you're looking for, and enter your name, email, and a password.

The next few screens will guide you gently through our profile creation process. You will enter your date of birth, then select any and all from a list of hobbies and interests that align with who you are! You have the option to add and remove hobbies and interests later, too so don't worry if you change your mind. Finally, you will have a chance to write a short blurb that will tell other users about you. Be creative but don't sweat it! Just be yourself.

After finishing your set-up process, you will be directed to your profile page. All of your information that you have entered so far will show up here. This is also the page that other users will see when they find you!

Start by uploading a profile image on the left side of your screen. After selecting the image from your device or another source, hit the refresh button that appears and voila! Everyone can now see your beautiful smiling face. You also have the option to add other images into a gallery that will appear on the right side of the screen. Select one or multiple images and upload them the same way you did for your profile picture.

Click on the matches icon (2nd icon in at the top navigation bar) to see cards of our curated list of users just for you. These users are chosen based on your gender, what you're looking for, as well as your selected hobbies and interests. Click on the heart icon in their card to save them to your favorites, then go to the InTarget page (3rd icon up top) to see more!

Here on the InTarget page you will find only a list of your chosen favorites. Each will have their profile picture that links to their profile page. You can also choose to un-favorite them by clicking the broken heart icon, or send them a message by clicking on the chat bubble and writing out what you'd like to say!

On the last page, you will find your back-and-forth conversations with each of your matches. Note: only those you have in your favorites will show up here, so if you message someone and then remove them from your favorites, their conversation won't appear here until you decide you'd like to give them another chance (and favorite them again). Click on the picture of who you'd like to talk to and write your message at the bottom! Our system runs a check on every incoming message that will flag your account if you speak in a toxic manner so be polite! You will get a chance to change your mind if we find what you write toxic so don't worry.

Finally, when you're ready to go, click on the broken heart icon in the top right of any screen. This will log you out to the main page where you can log in again or pass the computer to your friend to give them a try!
